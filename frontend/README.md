## Installation

1) Install `npm` / `node`
2) Run `npm install` from the root of the this project (the frontend part)
3) Build the files to serve with `npx webpack` (you may need to add the nodejs folder to your path if npx is not found)
4) Serve the `index.html` file and it should pull in the built `bundle.js` and `index.css` files
